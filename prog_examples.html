                            <p>
                                This Blog website is built using a Laravel framework, it was the final project for a PHP Web Development course. This website was built after I gained a strong understanding on user registration & login, password salting/hashing, user input forms with validation, SQL database management and preventing SQL injection.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                The site supports users with administration roles and will restrict administrator pages. Users login, create a blog post, comment on posts and follow other users.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                This project taught me how to use blade templating and the Laravel composer functionality to challenge myself to create a more complex website than I was familiar with.

                            <p>
                                Humans Vs Zombies is a simulation based on <em>Conway's Game of Life</em>. Zombies hunt humans to infect them and Humans flee to survive.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                 It uses a polymorphic algorithm to calculate different logic patterns. Zombies and Humans are objects of the "Organism" class and share core functionality. Humans can repopulate and Zombies can move diagonally, infect, move before Humans, prioritize attacking, and perish if they move 3+ times without eating.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                This taught me about how to use object pointers in C++ and to utilize a dynamic array to manage all entities. The game window is being displayed inside of a "Gnome Terminal".

                                A console application that reads a text maze and utilizes a pathing algorithm to navigate through the maze and find the exit and display the solution to the maze.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                The pointer moves through the maze and looks for dead-ends. When it finds a dead-end, it backtracks and marks that path as a dead-end then continues searching the next path.

                                <br/>

                                This program taught me how use a stack data structure to create a pathing algorithm. I was given starter code to study how a stack works and then utilize it.

                            <p>
                                This Snake game was created using Windows forms. The snake is controlled with the arrow keys, and running into the snake's body or walls will end the game. Red Apples are worth 1 point and Green apples are worth 6.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                This was a fun project for me since until this game I have never used C# for anything other than a chat application and text editor.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                It was also brand new to me to add pictures to Windows forms and have user input to control a form, so I ended up learning a lot from this game. I really enjoy creating games so it has been helpful to me to create a game in a new language to get a good feel for it.

                                This UWP application allows the user to select an mp3 file from their harddrive and play that song in the media player. The user can play, pause, and stop the playback and also use the slider to move to a specific point in the song. The data displayed in the center of the window is being read from the mp3 file's meta data.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                I learned a lot about file data from this application. Previously I have never used file metadata or played music from a file that was selected during runtime.

                                An E-Commerce website built on Java Enterprise Edition using a REST server. This was my first introduction to full-stack development, functional programming.

                                This was one of the more challenging projects I've completed during school. JEE was a tough concept to grasp but once I began to understand it I realized that it is a very powerful tool.
                                
                                <br/>

                                This project taught me a lot about expression language and scoping. This was a big learning experience for me and since this was assigned at the same time as the Laravel project, I learned a lot about time-management.

                            <p>
                                This is a low level project from my first course in Java and also my introduction to Object Oriented Programming. This screensaver program uses a polymorphic Shape object to share movement and collision methods.

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                On every collision with a wall, shapes flip direction and each shape has a chance to change state in many ways. They all may toggle outline/solid fill or change colour. Squares and Circles also have a chance of morphing into an instance of the others' class so a Circle has a chance to upcast to Shape and then downcast to a Square object and keep all other existing state settings. 

                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                On each click of the mouse, a shape is added to the program at runtime.

                                <div class="3u  6u(xsmall)" style="visibility: hidden;"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/AirplaneSeating.gif" alt="" /></span></div>

                                This program uses a 2D array to represent 16 seats of an airplane seating arrangement. The top 8 are 1st class and the bottom 8 are coach. 
                                
                                <br/>
                                <br/>

                                The User will input their name and then select if they want to sit in 1st class. After that they will select whether they prefer an aisle seat. Using this information, the program will check the 4 seats that apply to any combonation of selections and if the first seat is taken it will then check the next. At the end of seating, the program outputs a report showing all passengers names with their seat number.

                                This project was partially to learn about objects and storing objects to an array, the other learning component involved using a GUI for the first time.
